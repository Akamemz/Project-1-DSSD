## The official repository for information on GW DSSD's first project for the University of Nagoya's Education and Research Center for Sustainable Co-Development based in Japan

Message from Jason Lin at DSSD:

I'm attaching the relevant links that can help your team get started with the data exploration.  We will have a joint meeting with the Madison hub where they can give a more detailed overview of how the platform will work, what the analysis will look like, and hopefully we can clarify any questions you may have.   In the meantime, feel free to reach out whenever you want!

Here is the raw data: https://github.com/DSSD-Madison/Nagoya/blob/main/data/GeoDS4Bolivia.geojson
